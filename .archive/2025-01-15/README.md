# Archived Documentation - January 15, 2025

## Where This Content Went

The information from these files was:
1. **Consolidated** into comprehensive guides in `docs/database/`, `docs/operations/`, and `docs/guides/`
2. **Preserved** in the archive (this directory) for reference
3. **Replaced** with better-organized documentation in the main `docs/` structure

## New Documentation Structure

See:
- `docs/INDEX.md` - Complete documentation map
- `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` - Comprehensive entry guide
- `docs/database/` - Consolidated database and Supabase guides
- `docs/operations/` - Consolidated safety and operations guides
- `docs/guides/` - Consolidated feature guides including i18n

## Recovery

If you need information from any archived file:
1. Check this `.archive/2025-01-15/` directory
2. Files are preserved exactly as they were before deletion
3. Consider whether the information has been incorporated into the new consolidated docs
